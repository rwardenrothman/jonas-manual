## Lunch/Dinners
We have a bunch of dinners frozen for you to give him. They're in the kitchen freezer on the right side, top bin.
Some are in the silicon containers, which can be microwaved with the top off. Some are in FoodSaver "Meal Prep" bags.
These can also go in the microwave. All of our frozen mac & cheese is in these bags. I've tried to write the microwave times
on the FoodSaver things I'd expect him to want.

You can also order out wherever you want (we've yet to find a restaurant where Jonas won't eat anything). Some of our go-tos are:

He always wants mac & cheese from restaurants, but never actually eats it. Don't tell him it's an option. But otherwise,
you can list off the menu to him. The usual meals above are only suggestions.

## Desserts
* 1 or 2 cookies
* 1 piece of candy (from the bag in the pantry)
* Fruit
