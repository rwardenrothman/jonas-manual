## Morning Bottles
Before Jonas eats breakfast (or while he's eating) we make up 3 bottles for him

### Translucent green cup with flat green lid
Pour 4 oz of whole milk.

### Small stainless steel bottle
Fill bottle to the neck with whole milk.

### Large stainless steel bottle
Fill bottle to the neck with filtered water from the fridge. To avoid spilling, I usually hold the bottle under the nozzle
and push the pedal with my middle-pinky fingers.
